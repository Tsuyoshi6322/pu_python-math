# pu_python-math

Project for Uni classes of Python - approximising $\pi$, Pythagorean triples and Euler's number.

## Assignments

1. Write a code that approximates number pi.
    - Use Monte Carlo's method.
    - Test the program for 100 and 10K tries.

2. Write a code that definies and calculates Pythagorean Trio: $a^2+b^2=c^2$
    - Accept variables `a`,`b`,`c` as input.
    - Include a check to verify if they form a right triangle.

3. Write a code that calculates the sum for any value `n` using the formula
    $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}(2k-1)$$

4. Write a code that approximates Euler's number using the infinite series
    $$e = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}$$
